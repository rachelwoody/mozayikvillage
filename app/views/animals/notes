Use this code in views/animals/show.html.erb to allow admin to add new animal resources:

<% if @user.admin == true
</div>
    <%= button_to "Create a new animal resource.", create_path, :class => "adminbutton", :method => :get %>
<div>

<% end %>

**Add the editAnimal_path route:

get 'resources/create', to: 'resources#create', as create_path
